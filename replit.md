# QuantDeck - Quantitative Trading Dashboard

## Overview

QuantDeck is a full-stack web application for quantitative trading analysis and strategy backtesting. It provides a modern, interactive dashboard for analyzing financial data, implementing trading strategies, and visualizing performance results. The application integrates Python-based quantitative models with a React frontend to create a comprehensive trading research platform.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Overall Architecture
The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend, backend, and data layers:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, built with Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript serving API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Python Services**: Separate Python microservices for quantitative analysis
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

### Design Philosophy
The architecture prioritizes modularity, type safety, and developer experience. The backend serves as an API gateway that orchestrates calls to specialized Python services for data processing and strategy execution.

## Key Components

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **Component Architecture**: Uses shadcn/ui for consistent design system
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, local React state for UI
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming

### Backend (Express.js)
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for strategies, backtests, and market data
- **Python Integration**: Spawns Python processes for computationally intensive tasks
- **Storage Abstraction**: Memory storage with database interface for future scaling
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes

### Python Services
- **Strategy Service**: Manages different trading strategy implementations
- **Data Service**: Handles market data fetching via yfinance
- **Backtest Service**: Executes strategy backtests and performance calculations
- **Base Strategy Pattern**: Abstract base class for consistent strategy interfaces

### Database Schema
- **Users**: User authentication and management
- **Strategies**: Trading strategy configurations and parameters
- **Backtests**: Backtest configurations and results
- **Trades**: Individual trade records from backtests
- **Market Data**: Cached market data for performance

## Data Flow

### Trading Strategy Workflow
1. **Data Selection**: User selects ticker and date range
2. **Strategy Configuration**: User chooses and configures trading strategies
3. **Backtest Execution**: Backend orchestrates Python services to run backtests
4. **Results Visualization**: Frontend displays performance metrics and charts

### API Communication
- Frontend makes requests to Express.js API endpoints
- Express.js spawns Python processes for quantitative computations
- Python services return JSON results back through the API layer
- Frontend updates UI with real-time progress and results

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. Market data fetched via yfinance in Python
2. Technical indicators calculated using pandas/numpy
3. Trading signals generated by strategy implementations
4. Backtest engine simulates trades and calculates performance metrics
5. Results serialized and returned to frontend for visualization

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React, React Query, Wouter for routing
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives via shadcn/ui
- **Charts**: Recharts for financial data visualization
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **Development**: Vite for build tooling, tsx for development server
- **Process Management**: Node.js child_process for Python integration

### Python Dependencies (Inferred)
- **Data**: yfinance for market data, pandas for data manipulation
- **Analysis**: numpy for numerical computations, scipy for statistical functions
- **ML**: TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM models, scikit-learn for traditional ML
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, plotly for chart generation

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Setup
- **Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with client, server, and shared code
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend, esbuild bundles backend
- **Development Server**: Hot reload for both frontend and backend
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend

### Production Considerations
- **Database**: Configured for PostgreSQL with environment-based URLs
- **Python Environment**: Requires Python 3.x with quantitative libraries
- **Process Management**: Backend spawns Python processes for strategy execution
- **Static Assets**: Frontend builds to dist/public for serving

### Scaling Architecture
- **Database**: Ready for PostgreSQL deployment with Drizzle migrations
- **Caching**: Market data caching layer for performance
- **Microservices**: Python services can be containerized separately
- **CDN**: Static assets can be served from CDN in production

### Environment Configuration
- **Database URL**: Required for PostgreSQL connection
- **Development vs Production**: Different build processes and serving strategies
- **Python Path**: Backend needs access to Python interpreter and libraries
- **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests in development
